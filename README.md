=DayToDay

A simple calendar widget that allows day-by-day configuration.

==omg! another calendar?

Yep! I needed to have a calendar that I had full control over--including how each day rendered AND the events on each day fired.

==what can I do?

- where to render the calendar (container)
- a pluggable function to decorate each calendar day (dayDecorator)
- the date to base your calendar off of (selectedDate)
- the JSON/array/whatever data that is passed to your dayDecorator (events)
- include navigation (next month, last month, today)  (includeNavigation)
- include mindnumbing debugging information to the console (debug)
